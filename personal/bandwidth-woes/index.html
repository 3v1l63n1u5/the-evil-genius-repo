        <p><em>&#8220;Lets buy a cheap <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">Blackberry</a>&#174;&#8220;</em>-I said to my mom in <a href="http://www.dohaairport.com/">Doha International Airport</a>&#8217;s departure lounge while leaving for Bangladesh on 5th of April, 2013. I was so naive back then, so naive and juvenile and stupid. My logic was I would at least stay connected to my mail servers while I am acquiring an internet subscription which can take some time to get in Bangladesh. I used the <a href="http://www.ooredoo.qa/en/SP_BLACKBERRY">Blackberry&#174; Internet Services</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> for as long as I can remember, and while you might squint at this, let me iterate that Blackberry devices along with BIS in particular is highly popular in the Middle-East. Considering the social environment and the whole rainy season deal, a cheap Blackberry handset looked like a viable option. So I got myself a <a href="http://uk.blackberry.com/smartphones/blackberry-curve-8520.html">Blackberry&#174; 8520</a>, which is not a great phone in anyways, but it handled my email requirements like a breeze as all the Blackberry devices are made to do. I stayed connected to my email account during the whole flight, even during takeoff, while the in-flight email services cost $1 per email viewing/sending, the Blackberry service is absolutely free of cost in-flight<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and a delight to use.  </p>

<p>The problem started as soon as we entered Bangladeshi airspace and the pilots got ready for landing. The pilots turned off the <a href="http://www.qatarairways.com/ae/en/inflight-mobile-services.page">in-flight mobile network</a> and my device went on a frantic search for a network to join in. The moment our plane touched down on the hard-gravel of the airstrip, my device joined a network named <a href="http://www.robi.com.bd/">Robi</a>&#174;, and suddenly my email services stopped. I tried to register the Host Routing Tables while still the plane moved slowly towards the airport building to disembark the passengers. At first, I thought maybe its a network glitch that my Blackberry services are not working and a device reboot would fix that. Anyways, we disembarked and was on our merry way to my uncle&#8217;s apartment in Tongi before I could even know that there are ABSOLUTELY NO BIS in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>On the night of our arrival, I was talking to my cousin about a small project of his, and he said he will send some of the files to me through email. It was about an hour later after he had gone home, I rebooted my phone as planned and it looked like I was getting an EDGE network variant signal on my device. The registration message was getting queued when I tried to register my HRTs. It dawned upon me that maybe BIS isn&#8217;t provided in the Robi network. I switched to <a href="http://www.grameenphone.com/">Grameenphone</a>&#174;&#8217;s network with a manual network search, and it stayed the same. Several reboots later I called my cousin and he could not confirm me about this, he only made it worse saying that he saw some of his colleagues using Blackberry Email Services.  </p>

<p>Confused and tired, I let it go and asked my cousin to get me the most reliable internet package as soon as possible. He gave me two choices based on WIMAX technology as I would be moving around a lot-<a href="http://www.qubee.com.bd/">Qubee</a>&#174; and <a href="http://www.banglalionwimax.com/">Banglalion</a>&#174;. I chose Banglalion&#174; because it does not impose a download limit cap whilst Qubee&#174; imposes some sort of limit which deemed a little too low for my taste. With my mobile internet privileges  stripped down, I was quite anxious to get my hands on a new WIMAX dongle. While Bangladeshi telecommunications providers fail to provide basic connectivity even at barebone 3G standards (I honestly do not recall when I last saw the 3G sign up on my mobile screen, it was such a long time ago), they tend to excel in providing new connections at an astonishing pace. Although, the law requires one to register a connection by providing one&#8217;s National ID card/Passport, the general practice to acquire a connection usually requires a simple cash transaction. So by the next morning of my arrival, I was sifting through the bulks of emails I received the previous day with my new Banglalion&#174; WIMAX dongle with a guarantee to provide up to 2 MBPS down/512 MBPS up speed. This was the highest any provider offers to a non-corporate/home user. This was not much, but it was enough to barely get by. I thought I would cut down in collaborative computing, sent notifications to <a href="http://stats.kwsn.net/team.php?proj=sah&amp;teamid=134289&amp;sort_order=expavg_credit&amp;sort_direction=DESC">SETI@Qatar</a> that my personal computing resources will not be available for a few months, notified my colleagues to dial down the video streaming quality for the conference calls and decided that I would not be streaming any movies as much as I used to do.  </p>

<p>I did not notice it at first, I thought the stuttering speed of my connection could be attributed to the Received Signal Strength and Carrier to Interference + Noise Reduction ratios. The interference could get really high and the bandwidth quality can decrease. Or at least that was my theory. Soon another of my cousin wanted to use my dongle. He figured out that my ISP was not delivering as promised. This cousin of mine was born and brought up in Bangladesh and he had all the tricks up his sleeves to squeeze the bandwidth from the ISPs. We ran a Bandwidth test at <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">speedtest.net</a>&#169; and this is the result we got, my previous connection speed is put side by side for quick comparison:  </p>

<p>This is the highest I ever got, 1.76 MBPS down, with the maximum upload speed reaching upto 0.33 MBPS. Now thats not even close to advertised speed. The numbers may look close enough, but when the upper limit of your numerical universe is bounded at 2, 1.76 is really bad and translates to a 88% delivery rate. When someone buys a 2 MBPS connection, he expects a stable 2 MBPS connection, period. Even with the false expectations of this connection, I was still considering cutting down on many areas. Now that I realized the horror, I had to figure something out, and figure that out quickly. I make a living through staying in touch with people and this was unacceptable. On a quick phone call with the Banglalion&#174; Customer Care, I quickly learned that their 2 MBPS connection is merely a bloated 1 MBPS connection. In Lehman&#8217;s terms, the antenna in the device pretends itself as a double antenna and receives two concurrent 1 MBPS signals, which sometimes can cause interference with each other, and hence create a bottleneck in the bandwidth stream. In good signal reception areas, this is not a problem, but inside buildings in a moderate signal strength area might cause this auto-interference to generate and deliver a sluggishly performance. The solution: to get an 1 MBPS connection which will be alright on its own, and maybe add in more 1 MBPS connections, place each of these at appropriate distances and combine  all the bandwidth with a load balancing system. On that phone call with the customer care representative, I changed my connection to 1 MBPS and started digging. I knew I had to devise a plan if I had to have a decent online experience. I generated a Time (m) vs Downloaded data (MB) scatter plot containing the first 10 sets of data. From that data, I could generate the linear regression and the equation of the line. The interactive plot is given below:</p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/static/modules/gviz/1.0/chart.js"> {"dataSourceUrl":"//docs.google.com/spreadsheet/tq?key=0Astf0wkqJrIddDNYYkk2XzFpQVU4bFlxV1ZHUXRRdHc&transpose=0&headers=1&range=A1%3AB12&gid=0&pub=1","options":{"titleTextStyle":{"bold":true,"color":"#000","fontSize":16},"series":{"0":{"color":"#ff0000"}},"animation":{"duration":0},"pointSize":7,"width":897,"lineWidth":0,"hAxis":{"useFormatFromData":false,"title":"Time in minutes","formatOptions":{"source":"inline","suffix":" m"},"slantedTextAngle":60,"slantedText":true,"minValue":0,"viewWindowMode":"pretty","format":"0.##' m'","viewWindow":{"min":0,"max":null},"maxValue":null},"vAxes":[{"title":"Downloaded Data in MegaBytes","useFormatFromData":false,"formatOptions":{"source":"inline","suffix":" MB"},"minValue":null,"format":"0.##' MB'","viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"logScale":false,"maxValue":null},{"useFormatFromData":true,"minValue":null,"viewWindow":{"min":null,"max":null},"logScale":false,"maxValue":null}],"title":"Time (m) vs Bandwidth (MB)","booleanRole":"certainty","height":481,"legend":"in","focusTarget":"series","useFirstColumnAsDomain":false,"tooltip":{}},"state":{},"view":{},"isDefaultVisualization":false,"chartType":"ScatterChart","chartName":"Chart 1"} </script>

<p>Now for a days work, I need roughly 8 GB of data download and 1 GB of upload, I calculated. This will barely get me by. Now to do that efficiently, I figured out the line equation from the linear equation which is $y=\frac{72883\, x}{10000} - \frac{311}{10000}$ with $R^2=1$, its a perfect fit, where x is the amount of time in minutes and y is the amount of Downloaded Data in MB. I ran the experiment with this for a few days and found out that to consume 8 GB of data takes me around 23+ hours in an 1 MBPS connection, Now thats acceptable, considering that I will be working with the previous days downloaded data on the next day, and while working I will be downloading for the day after. But on somedays the required download would exceed 8 GBs, that means, it would create a backlog until someday the download requirements decrease. I did not mind running one of my PCs to run 24/7 to do this job for me, but the backlog issue made me consider the multiple connection combination again.  </p>

<p>Now a days, I use <a href="http://www.connectify.me/dispatch/">Connectify Dispatch</a>&#174; to combine multiple connections, this works for torrent downloads pretty nicely, most of the HTTP downloads I usually do supports multiple socket concurrent downloading. For FTP downloads, I get a steady 1 MBPS down stream, I find it acceptable considering I do not require that much of FTP downloading.  </p>

<p>For the time being, it looks like most of my internet requirements are met by some minimum standards, but somehow my bandwidth woes remain. How can one ever go back from the high bandwidth era to the 90s?</p>
